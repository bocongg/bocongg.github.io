I am Bo Cong, currently a Year 3 student at NUS majoring in Life Sciences. While my passion for biological sciences has been with me since my secondary school days, I also consider myself to be a tech-savvy person and in recent times I have gained interest in web and app development. I first began exploring web development using C++ in 2018, inspired by an in-game friend who created a website for our favourite game, but it was unfruitful because I lacked guidance. Then in 2020, there was an opportunity for Full-time National Servicemen (NSF) to receive governmental funding support to attend short virtual Infocomm Technology courses, which I jumped in and learnt app development using React Native. However, I found the learning curve to be too steep. Now that I'm in university, I have had the chance to enroll in various courses (i.e. [LSM2302](https://nusmods.com/courses/LSM2302/computational-thinking-for-life-sciences) and currently [NM2207](https://nusmods.com/courses/NM2207/computational-media-literacy)) with more structured curriculum to improve my coding skills while deepening my passion for biomedical sciences. In the future, I hope to merge my knowledge in Life Sciences with web development to value-add to this field.\n\n\nNational University of Singapore\\\nLife Sciences \\| 2021 - 2025\n\nSingapore Polytechnic\\\nBiomedical Sciences \\| 2016 - 2019\n\n#### **Hobbies**\n\nPhotography \\| Videography \\| Watching Films (Just completed: The Blacklist)\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nHello!
