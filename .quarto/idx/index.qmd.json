The maximum R value\n\n-   Across the months, some hospitals experience greater fluctuations in variation of R (i.e. SKH had a 0.695 difference between the highest and lowest R) while others experience smaller fluctuations (i.e. NUH with only a difference of 0.154).\n\n-   In SGH, the maximum and minimum R values are 0.8 and 0.6 respectively, which are both the highest among all the hospitals. Therefore, it seems that bed occupancy rate is a good predictor of waiting time for admission to a ward in SGH.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#################################################################\nwait_times <- read_csv(\"./proj_app/test_waiting_time.csv\")\n\nbed_occ <- read_csv(\"./proj_app/test_BOR.csv\")\n\nEMD_attendance <- read_csv(\"./proj_app/test_EMD_attendance.csv\")\n\n\ntidy_wait_times <- wait_times %>%\n  separate(col = Date, into = c(\"Day_wk\", \"Date\"), sep = \", \") %>%\n  mutate(new_Date_format = \n           parse_date_time(Date, orders = c(\"mdy\", \"dmy\", \"ymd\"))) %>%\n  mutate(Dates = format(new_Date_format, \"%d/%m/%Y\")) %>%\n  separate(col = Date, into = c(\"Day\", \"Month\", \"Year\"), sep = \"/\") %>%\n  gather(key = hospital, value = wait_duration, 5:12 ) %>%\n  select(Day_wk, Dates, Day, Month, Year, hospital, wait_duration)\n\ntidy_bed_occ <- bed_occ %>%\n  filter(Years == 2023) %>%\n  mutate(new_Date_format = \n           parse_date_time(Date, orders = c(\"mdy\", \"dmy\", \"ymd\"))) %>%\n  mutate(Dates = format(new_Date_format, \"%d/%m/%Y\")) %>%\n  gather(key = hospital, value = occ_rate, 3:10) %>%\n  separate(col = occ_rate, into = c(\"occ_rate\"), sep = \"%\") %>%\n  mutate(occ_rate_num = as.numeric(occ_rate)) %>%\n  select(occ_rate_num)\n\ntidy_EMD_attendance <- EMD_attendance %>%\n  separate(col = Date, into = c(\"Day_wk\", \"Date\"), sep = \", \") %>%\n  mutate(new_Date_format = \n           parse_date_time(Date, orders = c(\"mdy\", \"dmy\", \"ymd\"))) %>%\n  mutate(Dates = format(new_Date_format, \"%d/%m/%Y\")) %>%\n  separate(col = Date, into = c(\"Day\", \"Month\", \"Year\"), sep = \"/\") %>%\n  gather(key = hospital, value = attendance, 5:12) %>%\n  select(attendance)\n\nfinal_dataset <- cbind(tidy_wait_times,tidy_bed_occ,tidy_EMD_attendance) %>%\n  select(Month, hospital, wait_duration, occ_rate_num, attendance)\n################################################################\ncolumns <- c(\"AH\", \"CGH\", \"KTPH\", \"NTFGH\", \"NUH(A)\", \"SGH\", \"SKH\", \"TTSH\")\nrows <- c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\")\nscatterBORtable <- matrix(nrow = length(rows), ncol = length(columns)) %>%\n                  data.frame()\nrownames(scatterBORtable) <- rows\ncolnames(scatterBORtable) <- columns\n\nfor (h in 1:8){\n  for (m in 1:9){\n    scatterBORdata <- final_dataset %>%\n      filter(Month == paste(\"0\", m, sep = \"\") &\n               hospital == colnames(scatterBORtable)[h])\n    \n    cor_coeff <- cor(scatterBORdata$occ_rate_num, scatterBORdata$wait_duration)\n    scatterBORtable[m,h] <- round(cor_coeff,3)\n  }\n}\n#############################################################\nscatterEMDtable <- matrix(nrow = length(rows), ncol = length(columns)) %>%\n                  data.frame()\nrownames(scatterEMDtable) <- rows\ncolnames(scatterEMDtable) <- columns\n\nfor (h in 1:8){\n  for (m in 1:9){\n    scatterEMDdata <- final_dataset %>%\n      filter(Month == paste(\"0\", m, sep = \"\") &\n               hospital == colnames(scatterEMDtable)[h])\n    \n    cor_coeff <- cor(scatterEMDdata$attendance, scatterEMDdata$wait_duration)\n    scatterEMDtable[m,h] <- round(cor_coeff,3)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nscatterBORtable <- mutate(scatterBORtable, ID = row_number())\ndatatable(scatterBORtable, caption = 'Table 1: Correlation Coefficients for Bed Occupancy Rate and Waiting Time.')\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### EMD Attendances vs Waiting Times\n\nThe tables below show the correlation coefficients (R) when the independent variable (EMD Attendance) was plotted against the dependent variable (Waiting Time).\n\nFrom the data, we can observe that:\n\n-   The maximum correlation between EMD attendance and Waiting Time is within the 0.3 range for AH and SKH, 0.5 range for CGH, KTPH, NUH and TTSH, and 0.6 range for NTFGH and SGH, with SGH having the highest maximum R value of 0.65.\n\n-   The minimum correlation across all hospitals range from -0.185 in SKH to 0.31 in TTSH.\n\n-   Generally, the range between these maximum and minimum correlations are small with a majority being 0.5 and below. This indicates that there is a low correlation between EMD Attendances and Waiting Time (Calkins, 2005).\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nscatterEMDtable <- mutate(scatterEMDtable, ID = row_number())\ndatatable(scatterEMDtable, caption = 'Table 2: Correlation Coefficients for EMD Attendance and Waiting Time.')\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the data analysis above, we can conclude that Bed Occupancy Rates generally have a higher correlation with Waiting Times as compared to EMD Attendance. The correlation is stronger in hospitals with a smaller range between the maximum and minimum R value, with all monthly correlations above 0.5. Since NUH and SGH fit these criteria, we can use the Bed Occupancy Rates to predict Waiting Time in these hospitals. No hospital fit these criteria for correlation between EMD Attendance and Waiting Time, hence the daily attendance figures at the EMD cannot be used to predict the waiting time for admission to a ward.\n\n## References\n\nCalkins, K.

The maximum R value\n\n-   Across the months, some hospitals experience greater fluctuations in variation of R (i.e. SKH had a 0.695 difference between the highest and lowest R) while others experience smaller fluctuations (i.e. NUH with only a difference of 0.154).\n\n-   In SGH, the maximum and minimum R values are 0.8 and 0.6 respectively, which are both the highest among all the hospitals. Therefore, it seems that bed occupancy rate is a good predictor of waiting time for admission to a ward in SGH.\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nlibrary(DT)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n#################################################################\nwait_times <- read_csv(\"./proj_app/test_waiting_time.csv\")\n\nbed_occ <- read_csv(\"./proj_app/test_BOR.csv\")\n\nEMD_attendance <- read_csv(\"./proj_app/test_EMD_attendance.csv\")\n\n\ntidy_wait_times <- wait_times %>%\n  separate(col = Date, into = c(\"Day_wk\", \"Date\"), sep = \", \") %>%\n  mutate(new_Date_format = \n           parse_date_time(Date, orders = c(\"mdy\", \"dmy\", \"ymd\"))) %>%\n  mutate(Dates = format(new_Date_format, \"%d/%m/%Y\")) %>%\n  separate(col = Date, into = c(\"Day\", \"Month\", \"Year\"), sep = \"/\") %>%\n  gather(key = hospital, value = wait_duration, 5:12 ) %>%\n  select(Day_wk, Dates, Day, Month, Year, hospital, wait_duration)\n\ntidy_bed_occ <- bed_occ %>%\n  filter(Years == 2023) %>%\n  mutate(new_Date_format = \n           parse_date_time(Date, orders = c(\"mdy\", \"dmy\", \"ymd\"))) %>%\n  mutate(Dates = format(new_Date_format, \"%d/%m/%Y\")) %>%\n  gather(key = hospital, value = occ_rate, 3:10) %>%\n  separate(col = occ_rate, into = c(\"occ_rate\"), sep = \"%\") %>%\n  mutate(occ_rate_num = as.numeric(occ_rate)) %>%\n  select(occ_rate_num)\n\ntidy_EMD_attendance <- EMD_attendance %>%\n  separate(col = Date, into = c(\"Day_wk\", \"Date\"), sep = \", \") %>%\n  mutate(new_Date_format = \n           parse_date_time(Date, orders = c(\"mdy\", \"dmy\", \"ymd\"))) %>%\n  mutate(Dates = format(new_Date_format, \"%d/%m/%Y\")) %>%\n  separate(col = Date, into = c(\"Day\", \"Month\", \"Year\"), sep = \"/\") %>%\n  gather(key = hospital, value = attendance, 5:12) %>%\n  select(attendance)\n\nfinal_dataset <- cbind(tidy_wait_times,tidy_bed_occ,tidy_EMD_attendance) %>%\n  select(Month, hospital, wait_duration, occ_rate_num, attendance)\n################################################################\ncolumns <- c(\"AH\", \"CGH\", \"KTPH\", \"NTFGH\", \"NUH(A)\", \"SGH\", \"SKH\", \"TTSH\")\nrows <- c(\"Jan\", \"Feb\", \"Mar\", \"Apr\", \"May\", \"Jun\", \"Jul\", \"Aug\", \"Sep\")\nscatterBORtable <- matrix(nrow = length(rows), ncol = length(columns)) %>%\n                  data.frame()\nrownames(scatterBORtable) <- rows\ncolnames(scatterBORtable) <- columns\n\nfor (h in 1:8){\n  for (m in 1:9){\n    scatterBORdata <- final_dataset %>%\n      filter(Month == paste(\"0\", m, sep = \"\") &\n               hospital == colnames(scatterBORtable)[h])\n    \n    cor_coeff <- cor(scatterBORdata$occ_rate_num, scatterBORdata$wait_duration)\n    scatterBORtable[m,h] <- round(cor_coeff,3)\n  }\n}\n#############################################################\nscatterEMDtable <- matrix(nrow = length(rows), ncol = length(columns)) %>%\n                  data.frame()\nrownames(scatterEMDtable) <- rows\ncolnames(scatterEMDtable) <- columns\n\nfor (h in 1:8){\n  for (m in 1:9){\n    scatterEMDdata <- final_dataset %>%\n      filter(Month == paste(\"0\", m, sep = \"\") &\n               hospital == colnames(scatterEMDtable)[h])\n    \n    cor_coeff <- cor(scatterEMDdata$attendance, scatterEMDdata$wait_duration)\n    scatterEMDtable[m,h] <- round(cor_coeff,3)\n  }\n}\n```\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nscatterBORtable <- mutate(scatterBORtable, ID = row_number())\ndatatable(scatterBORtable, caption = 'Table 1: Correlation Coefficients for Bed Occupancy Rate and Waiting Time.')\n```\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### EMD Attendances vs Waiting Times\n\nThe tables below show the correlation coefficients (R) when the independent variable (EMD Attendance) was plotted against the dependent variable (Waiting Time).\n\nFrom the data, we can observe that:\n\n-   The maximum correlation between EMD attendance and Waiting Time is within the 0.3 range for AH and SKH, 0.5 range for CGH, KTPH, NUH and TTSH, and 0.6 range for NTFGH and SGH, with SGH having the highest maximum R value of 0.65.\n\n-   The minimum correlation across all hospitals range from -0.185 in SKH to 0.31 in TTSH.\n\n-   Generally, the range between these maximum and minimum correlations are small with a majority being 0.5 and below. This indicates that there is a low correlation between EMD Attendances and Waiting Time (Calkins, 2005).\n\n```{r, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE}\nscatterEMDtable <- mutate(scatterEMDtable, ID = row_number())\ndatatable(scatterEMDtable, caption = 'Table 2: Correlation Coefficients for EMD Attendance and Waiting Time.')\n```\n\n## Conclusion\n\nBased on the data analysis above, we can conclude that Bed Occupancy Rates generally have a higher correlation with Waiting Times as compared to EMD Attendance. The correlation is stronger in hospitals with a smaller range between the maximum and minimum R value, with all monthly correlations above 0.5. Since NUH and SGH fit these criteria, we can use the Bed Occupancy Rates to predict Waiting Time in these hospitals. No hospital fit these criteria for correlation between EMD Attendance and Waiting Time, hence the daily attendance figures at the EMD cannot be used to predict the waiting time for admission to a ward.\n\n## References\n\nCalkins, K.
