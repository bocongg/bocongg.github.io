    "text": "What contributes to the difference in wait times for admission to wards in local public hospitals?\nThe CNA had reported in April 2023 that the median waiting time for ward admissions had increased from about 5 hours to 7.2 hours during that period1. The health ministry had explained that it was due to the rise in number of older patients with more complex medical needs requiring longer hospitalisation1. Due to the ageing population in Singapore, long waiting time for admission to wards has been a long-standing issue over the years, and it was further exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic2,3.\n \n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Hello! I am Bo Cong, currently a Year 3 student at NUS majoring in Life Sciences. While my passion for biological sciences has been with me since my secondary school days, I also consider myself to be a tech-savvy person and in recent times I have gained interest in web and app development. I first began exploring web development using C++ in 2018, inspired by an in-game friend who created a website for our favourite game, but it was unfruitful because I lacked guidance. Then in 2020, there was an opportunity for Full-time National Servicemen (NSF) to receive governmental funding support to attend short virtual Infocomm Technology courses, which I jumped in and learnt app development using React Native. However, I found the learning curve to be too steep. Now that I’m in university, I have had the chance to enroll in various courses (i.e. LSM2302 and currently NM2207) with more structured curriculum to improve my coding skills while deepening my passion for biomedical sciences. In the future, I hope to merge my knowledge in Life Sciences with web development to value-add to this field.\n\nEducation\nNational University of Singapore\nLife Sciences | 2021 - 2025\nSingapore Polytechnic\nBiomedical Sciences | 2016 - 2019\n\n\nHobbies\nPhotography | Videography | Watching Films (Just completed: The Blacklist)\n\n\n\n Back to top"
